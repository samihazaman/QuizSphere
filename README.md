## Participating Team Members:

Samiha Zaman, Reiad Sakoor, Bhupendra Pariyar, Mani Azem

## Team Roles:

**Samiha: Backend Developer**
- Implemented backend functionality for the Quiz Page, such as developing JavaScript logic to fetch questions from a JSON file and handle user interactions with answer selection and feedback.
- Handled dynamic rendering of quiz data using EJS templates.

**Reiad: Frontend and Server side**
- Engineered the mainpage with a responsive design across all devices, leveraging flexbox layout and various animations to increase user engagement and a consistent experience   
- Assisted with initializing the server

**Bhupendra: Results page,Leaderboard and Players history**

- On the frontend, it uses EJS to display the userâ€™s score and a leaderboard, with buttons to restart or end the quiz handled by JavaScript.
- On the backend, it processes scores via Express, updates an in-memory leaderboard, sorts it, and limits it to the top 10 before rendering the results. This integrates templating, routing, and state management for an interactive experience.
