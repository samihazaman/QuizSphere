- MongoDB data to store user information as well as their play history 
- Server side rendering using ExpressJS framework for NodeJS and EJS templating language
  
## Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling language to design and layout the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for client-side and server-side logic.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js to handle routing and server setup.
- **EJS**: Templating engine used for rendering dynamic content on the web pages.

## Participating Team Members:

Samiha Zaman, Reiad Sakoor, Bhupendra Pariyar, Mani Azem

## Team Roles:

**Samiha: Backend Developer**
- Implemented backend functionality for the Quiz Page, such as developing JavaScript logic to fetch questions from a JSON file and handle user interactions with answer selection and feedback.
- Handled dynamic rendering of quiz data using EJS templates.

**Reiad: Login and Signup Pages**
- Implemented the frontend display with flexbox structure, form handling and dynamic color range
- Developed the backend functionality by initializing routers with form post/get requests, implemented crypto password hashing, stored user information in MongoDB and ensured error handling

**Bhupendra: Results page,Leaderboard and Players history**

- On the frontend, it uses EJS to display the userâ€™s score and a leaderboard, with buttons to restart or end the quiz handled by JavaScript.
- On the backend, it processes scores via Express, updates an in-memory leaderboard, sorts it, and limits it to the top 10 before rendering the results. This integrates templating, routing, and state management for an interactive experience.
- Worked on players history record so when they login they can see their past scores.

**Mani: Backend and Server side**

- Configured core server setup in app.js, integrating middleware for logging, parsing, cookies, and static files.
- Set up the EJS view engine and defined routes (/, /quiz, /results).
- Implemented error handling for smooth operation and reliability.
